# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

# Task Manager App

This project is a task manager application built using React, following an atomic structure, and utilizing Vite for fast development.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

```bash 
# Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/jyothirmai5/job-planr-project.git

## Navigate into the project directory:
cd job-panr-project

# Install dependencies using npm:
npm install

# Run the development server:
npm run dev

# This command will start the development server. You can now view your Task Manager application in the browser.

```

## Atomic Structure
This project follows the atomic design methodology for structuring components. Atomic design  is a methodology for creating design systems by breaking down UI into its smallest components.

The atomic design methodology consists of five distinct levels:

Atoms: The smallest building blocks of UI, such as buttons, inputs, etc.
Molecules: Combinations of atoms that form more complex UI elements, such as a form field with a label and input.
Organisms: Groups of molecules joined together to form a section of a UI, such as a header or footer.
Templates: Complete page layouts composed of organisms.
Pages: Specific instances of templates, where actual content is populated.
By organizing your components in this way, you can create a more scalable and maintainable UI architecture.

## Vite
Vite is a fast build tool that significantly improves the development experience for modern web projects. It provides lightning-fast cold server start and instant hot module replacement (HMR) during development.

This project utilizes Vite to provide a fast and efficient development environment for your React applications.
